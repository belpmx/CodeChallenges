public class RepeatAnagram {
    /*
Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p anagrams in s.Â 
You may return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original
letters exactly once.
Example 1:
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
Constraints:
1 <= s.length, p.length &lt;= 3 * 104
s and p consist of lowercase English letters.
