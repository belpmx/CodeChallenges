/** <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/">...</a>
 *Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search
 * target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
